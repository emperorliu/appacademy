          If you are looking for a true best friend, the Bullmastiff
          might be for you. These large and powerful dogs make
          excellent companions because they are so loyal and protective.
          They will want to go with you everywhere, be part of everything
          you do, and will not do well behaviorally if they do not get
          the attention they crave.

          The Black Russian Terrier is large, intelligent, robust,
          powerful, protective, and territorial. He loves his family
          deeply but is aloof and distrustful toward strangers. He is
          a good watchdog, and doesn't usually bark unless there's a
          reason. He is born with an instinct to guard and protect,
          and he will protect your family, yard, house, and vehicle.

          Do you want to bring a gentle giant into your home?
          I'm talking giant. He will be able to rest his head
          on the dining room table. And if you look away, he will
          steal the food off your plate! And did I mention that they
          eat a lot of food! They are eating-machines. Irish Wolfhounds
          are big sweethearts and will want (need) to be part of your
          family. They are affectionate, not as cuddly as some other
          breeds, but they still want to be with you. They do not do
          well if left alone for hours on end. These are active dogs
          who need daily exercise to be happy. They love to take long
          walks, but be prepared to bring large plastic bags with you!
          (To pick up his large messes).
